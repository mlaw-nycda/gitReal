		<a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <p>Git stash is a way to store the changes that you've made on a branch without having to commit them
      or add them to a project that is being worked on. It's perfect for when you're in the middle of something
    and you want to switch to doing something else.</p>

    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> If you see the following output when changing branches, you might want to consider using
    git stash. "Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches."</p>

    <p>To use stash, simply run:</p>
    <code>git stash</code>

    <p>You can view your stashed changes by running <code> git stash list </code>. This will show you a list of changes
    you have stored in the stash.</p>

    <p>You can apply any given stash to whichever part of your project you like by running the following command:<br>
      <code> git stash apply stash@{i} </code>. i = the number that corresponds to the stash you want to apply.</p>
